# S1 Handover Simulation using srsRAN 4G with ZeroMQ and Open5GS

## Overview
This project implements S1 Handover in a simulated environment using srsRAN 4G with ZeroMQ and Open5GS. Modifications to the setup were made to accommodate simulation requirements. Detailed documentation of changes and results can be found in the `config` and `log` directories, respectively.
